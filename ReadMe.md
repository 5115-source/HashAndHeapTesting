This repo is meant for basic hash map and heap testing. The programs lack any error correcting abilities as they are meant to work as a basic demo of these respective data types.

 - The [SimpleHashProgram](https://github.com/5115-source/HashAndHeapTesting/blob/main/SimpleHashProgram.py) file is a simple hash map demo.

 - The [SimpleHeapProgram](https://github.com/5115-source/HashAndHeapTesting/blob/main/SimpleHeapProgram.py) file is a simple heap demo.

This repo is nothing complex, it is just used to showcase the implementation of the hash map and heap data types.
